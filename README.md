# embedded-control


Hello!

This was part of a final project for ECE306, an embedded systems class. It is provided for the use of students in that class.

In the course, students control a car with an IoT module, which runs a TCP server. This program is a TCP client which sends command strings to the car, based on user input with a game controller.

Users will have to edit the code when the IP address of their car's IoT module changes. In addition, users will have to edit the strings sent by this program, to match the string syntax they've written for the car's code.

This project uses Jamepad (https://github.com/williamahartman/Jamepad), which is used in accordance with its license.

Good luck!
